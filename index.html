                <h2><strong>1.  What is racing all about?</strong> </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Formula One</strong> (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by Liberty Media, an American mass media company,
                    through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Formula One Group. The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural
                    season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for ''grand prizes' or 'great
                    prizes''), which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on closed public roads.
                </p>
                <img src="f1_BOLID.jpg" alt="Mercedes" title="Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes" class="middle">
                <h2><strong>2. What are general rules of F1 racing?</strong></h2>
                <h3> 1. The “One Move” Defending Rule </h3>

                <p>
                    Defending in Formula 1 is fairly similar to other open-wheel series. You can’t aggressively block a driver that’s trying to pass you;
                    it is rather against the rules. You can block to the inside, and be fairly aggressive, but weaving and similar manoeuvres are out of the question. Drivers do love to push the limits, though.
                </p>

                <h3>2.Drivers Must Qualify Within 107% Of The Pole-Sitter</h3>
                <p>
                    This rule was brought in a few years ago to make sure cars that were horribly slow didn’t get in the way of the rest of the grid. Effectively, each car must qualify within 107% of the fastest driver's lap time.
                    If a car drops out of the first stage in qualifying and is out of the 107%, they can still race to provide they were within that in practice sessions.
                </p>

                <h3>3. If an engine part is changed, they take a grid drop penalty</h3>
                <p>
                    This is something wildly unpopular. But it is a rule that is in place to try and stop crazy spending from the engine suppliers. Drivers are only allowed to use three engines a year, and some components either the same or twice.
                    If they exceed that (three control electronics units or more), they are given a drop of ten places. And that’s ten each time they go over once, five for any time after.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Speeding In The Pitlane? You Get A Penalty</h3>
                <p>
                    Do not speed in the F1 pitlane. That is a big no-no. Even in the early 1990s, the pitlane speed limit was not in existence. So cars would race in, serve their pitstop and then race back out of the pitlane.
                    Only after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger did F1 introduce a pitlane speed limit in 1994.
                </p>

                <h3>5. They Must Change Tyre Compounds In The Race </h3>
                <p>
                    Now don’t get confused. This isn’t simply about “drivers have to change tires.” Let’s break it down. There are three dry tire compounds that can be used in a race weekend and the race itself.
                    And in the race, a driver has to change compounds once. So in effect, there is a mandatory pitstop. But it has to be a change of compounds.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Safety Car Line Overtaking</h3>
                <p>
                    This rule refers to when drivers can overtake each other following the safety car coming in after an incident. So as they restart, there is a line where drivers, once they’ve passed it, can overtake each other. For a few years, that’s been the safety car line further down the pit straight.
                    Now though, they must wait until they reach the start/finish line. That was changed for 2019.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Rain Lights MUST Be Used In The Wet</h3>
                <p>
                    Another obvious rule. When the races become wet or tricky, Formula 1 cars have a rain light that is triggered and must be used to make sure those following behind can see where the cars in front are. With all that spray ahead,
                    it would be hard to see the guy in front otherwise.
                </p>

                <h2>3. About car</h2>
                <p>
                    A Formula One car is a single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front and rear wings, and an engine positioned behind the driver, intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing events.
                    The regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship and specify that cars must be constructed by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar ultra-lightweight materials. The minimum weight permissible is 740 kg (1,631 lb) including the driver but not fuel. Cars are weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted.
                    Prior to the 2014 F1 season, cars often weighed in under this limit so teams added ballast in order to add weight to the car. The advantage of using ballast is that it can be placed anywhere in the car to provide ideal weight distribution.
                    This can help lower the car's centre of gravity to improve stability and also allows the team to fine-tune the weight distribution of the car to suit individual circuits.
